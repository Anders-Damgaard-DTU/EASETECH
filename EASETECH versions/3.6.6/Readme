##3.6.4 Official Release, meaning checked by Anders Damgaard
##This release includes the option to have import a parameter list, where the user can make a checkmark that it should be included in a MonteCarlo/Perturbation analysis. To get a tick mark add a TRUE in the fourth column imported from excel. So for example as written in brackets here [Y; 1; ND(1,0.02); TRUE]. I suggest always copying from Excel as that seems most solid.
